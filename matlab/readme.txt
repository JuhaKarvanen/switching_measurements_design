Background:
==========

1) What is experimental design? optimal design? sequential design?

Experimental design is a plan how a test, a measurement or an experiment is
performed, especially how the values of controllable factors (covariates) are 
selected. Experimental design is the general term; optimal design and 
sequential design are experimental designs with some specific properties.

Optimal design tells which covariate values are the best according 
to some optimality criterion. For instance, often used D-optimality criterion
minimizes the generalized variance of the estimated parameters. 

Sequential design refers to situation where the experiment is performed in
several stages. The parameter estimates are updated after each stage and 
the new estimates are utilized in the design for the next stage. 

More information can be found, for example, from the references of the paper 
mentioned above. 

2) What are switching measurements? Josephson junctions?

The Josephson junctions (JJ) are important non-linear components of superconducting 
electronics. A junction involves two superconducting electrodes separated by an 
insulator gap. In practice, miniature JJ circuits are manufactured by lithographic 
means and operated at cryogenic temperatures, i.e., below 4.2 K. 

An experiment called switching measurement is a common way to probe the properties 
of a JJ circuit sample. In the experiment, sequences of current pulses are applied 
to the sample, while the voltage over the structure is monitored. The physical state 
of the JJ is described by the phase difference over the junction. A sufficiently 
high current pulse causes the  phase difference  to escape by tunneling from the 
local minimum of the potential to the direction of the steepest descent. This is 
called switching. In the experiment the observed voltage pulse indicates that 
switching has occurred.

A) optdesign function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The program calculates the optimal design for swithching measurements in 
superconducting Josephson junctions. More generally, the program calculates 
the optimal covariate points for binary response with complementary
log-log link. The optimality is defined as D-optimality and parameters are estimated 
by maximum likelihood estimation. The data is assumed to follow
Gompertz/Gumbel/extreme value distribution

               P(Y=1) = 1-exp(-exp(a*x+b)),

where a and b are the model parameters, x is the covariate variable and Y is the binary 
response. In the case of one Josephson junction this model arises from the laws of
physics. All data collected so far is given as an input to the program which then returns 
the optimal covariate points to be measured in next stage.

Sequential design with optdesign.m:

	1) Obtain the limits of the initial interval: xmin and xmax
	2) Measure at points xmin and xmax. Let x contain the points
	   of measurement and y contain the measured responses. 
	   (Sometimes it can be directly assumed that the response for 
	    xmin is 0 and the response for xmax is 1.)
	3) Call opdesign.m
	   [optx,betaest,betacov,IsMLE]=optdesign(x,y)
	4) If the required accuracy of betaest has been achieved, stop the 
	   procedure; otherwise proceed to the next step.
	5) Measure at the points given by optx. Append the points of measurement 
	   to x. Append the measured responses to y.
	6) Go to step 3.

The function is intended to be used for sequential designs of switching 
measurements but it may used for other suitable purposes as well.

Output:
optx			Points (pulse heights) to be measured at the next stage, length(optx)=2
                   If IsMLE==1 measure at both optx(1) and optx(2)
                   If IsMLE==0 measure only at optx(1).
betaest		Estimated values of parameters a and b
                   If IsMLE==0, an ad-hoc estimate is returned.
betacov        Estimated covariance matrix for parameters a and b,
                   size(betacov)=[2,2]
                   If IsMLE==0, betacov cannot be calculated and a matrix of NaN:s is returned.
IsMLE          Are the estimates maximum likelihood estimates? 0 or 1.
