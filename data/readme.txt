The measurements were made in Low Temperature Laboratory,
Helsinki University of Technology,  August 16, 2005.

The columns in the data set from left to right are:

 1. x1, measurement point 1 or height of pulse 1 in nanoamperes 
 2. x2, measurement point 2 or height of pulse 2 in nanoamperes
 3. n/2, number of pulses per point
 4. Number of responses 1 at x1
 5. Number of responses 1 at x2
 6. Estimate of parameter a
 7. Estimate of parameter b
 8. Variance of \hat{a}
 9. Covariance of \hat{a} and \hat{b}
 10. Covariance of \hat{a} and \hat{b}
 11. Variance of \hat{b}
 12. Indicator: are the estimates maximum likelihood estimates?
 13. Time used for measuring (in seconds)
 14. Time used for computing (in seconds)
